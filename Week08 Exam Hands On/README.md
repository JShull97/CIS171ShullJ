## Analysis / Design

From reading the instructions I already had a full plan in mind. Set up the stage and then write the event listeners and conversion methods. I used HBoxs to create the rows and added those to a VBox to stack the fields in the way I wanted.

### Testing

I didn't do much testing for this one as I already had to full plan in mind and knew how I wanted everything. The only thing that testing did bring to my attemtion was trying to convert when a field required for converison was empty, so I fixed that with an if statement.
