## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.MD)

## Analysis / Design

At first I didn't have a clue where to begin with this assignment, but after talking to my peers and referring to code provided in the book I was able to get started and the assignment turned out to be much easier than I thought at first. There wasn't much code to be done here, so it's all in one file but I created a package to hold the image.

### Testing 

Running the program after all the code was written to make sure the animation worked as intended.
