## Example Output

## Analysis/Design Steps

I started by building and positioning the pieces of the car in it's own class, and then in the main class, I created the buttons and event handlers for the program along with the path for the animation

### Testing

1. I had to run the program several times to build the trapezoid shape for the top of the car and positioning all the pieces together.
2. Then it was running the animation several times to get it to start and end right where I wanted, my goal was to get it to look as if it was scrolling off the stage and then scrolling back onto on the other end of the stage.
3. Lastly it was running the program to test out the key events to make sure they were functioning as intended.
